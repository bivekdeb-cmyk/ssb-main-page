 * /admission (2026-11-11, the user's asks): the live admission page
 * (scaler.com/school-of-business/admission/) rebuilt from the home page's sections, laid out after
 * SST's admission page. The dates and fees first, in a short first fold on the footer's green (not
 * the home page's film, so the page reads as its own), the deadline counting down in the top strip; the four steps as
 * one timeline; the video in a green band of its own, as the live SSB page has it; the scholarships (dark, as the live page has them); financing; the request-a-callback band last
 * before the footer. Copy and its open questions: src/content/admission.ts. The page keeps the home
 * page's `data-page` and calm entrance, so the deck styles and the one appear animation apply.
